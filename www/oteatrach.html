<h2>The Honking</h1>
<p>Really?! And why did 'I' have to take a cab? Belligerent and numerous. Who am I making this out to?</p>
<h2>Bend Her</h2>
<p>A true inspiration for the children. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. A sexy mistake.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.</li>
<li>And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.</li>
<li>Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!</li>
<li>I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.</li>

<p>I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Five hours? Aw, man!
